### INTRODUCTION

The library *centralDogma* provides different functions that allow the user to generate random DNA sequences, transcribe them, extract codons and generate base density plots, among others. The functions are below explained.

### FUNCTIONS

#### RANDOM_SEQ

This functions creates a random sequence. The length of the sequence is the input from the user (e.g. random_seq(9) will create a random DNA sequence of length 9).

#### TRANSCRIBE

This function uses a DNA sequence as input and returns its corresponding transcribed ARN by substituting "T" by "U". Example of use:

*transcribe("ACTG")* returns *"ACUG".*

#### GIVE_CODONS

The give_codons() function splits a DNA or RNA sequence into non-overlapping codons — groups of three consecutive nucleotides — starting from a user-defined reading frame. It is useful for translating nucleotide sequences into codon triplets for further analysis, such as identifying start and stop codons, calculating codon frequencies, or preparing data for translation into amino acids.

**Arguments**: sequence — a character string containing the nucleotide sequence (e.g., "ATGCCCGTA"). frame — an integer (1, 2, or 3) indicating the reading frame from which to start codon extraction. The default is 1.

**Returns**: A character vector of codons (three-letter strings). Bases that do not form a complete codon at the end of the sequence are ignored.

#### INPUT_DNA

This function will enter a DNA triplette sequence and output the corresponding one-letter amino acid. Can also function with sequences of DNA, outputting several amino acids.

#### BASE_DENSITY

This function plots the count of each base in the provided sequence.
